# Python Mega Course

### Module 1

#### Day 1
Day 1 is a building a todo app but instead of building a todo app
im going to be building a app for a game called Derail Valley its a pc game about hauling frieght 
to different parts of the map. 

This day is going over some basic of python

#### 05-10
going over the basics of python. basic inputs in such

instead of doing the todo list project, setting up to do my own some what of a simular project 
for a game that i will be getting here so. many inputs to fill in in to track. 

we installed the input options as the course is doing.

#### 05-14
working on storing the inputs into a list with [] 
ex: 
    user_prompt = 'Enter a todo'
    todo1 = input(user_prompt)
    todo2 = input(user_prompt)
    todo3 = input(user_prompt)
    todos = [todo1, todo2, todo3] data types for list to store inputs

#### 05-17
bonus example folder contains bonus code examples for each day small additional projects
start section 2 working with while and new python methods
creating a list outside of the while loop to store input
using dir(str) in console will show you all the methods for str data type
using the help("example".capitalize)
finshed day 2 starting day 3

#### 05-24 
starting to work on day 3 
main focus is using match case and for loops

to add a to new run or to view all runs.
first ask user to add a new run or to view

to stop a program use the "break" 

to get rid of [] and '' would do a statement of for item in category_list
so using the strip method it will strip whitespaces and such 
this also does not change the variables white spaces
